1||This book is for computer scientists, computer engineers, and others who want to be able to write better programs by learning what is going on "under the hood" of a computer system.
2||Our aim is to explain the enduring concepts underlying all computer systems, and to show you the concrete ways that these ideas affect the correctness, performance, and utility of your application programs. 
3||Many systems books are written from a builder's perspective, describing how to implement the hardware or the systems software, including the operating system, compiler, and network interface. 
4||This book is written from a programmer's perspective, describing how application programmers can use their knowledge of a system to write better programs. 
5||Of course, learning what a system is supposed to do provides a good first step in learning how to build one, so this book also serves as a valuable introduction to those who go on to implement systems hardware and software. 
6||Most systems books also tend to focus on just one aspect of the system, for example, the hardware architecture.
7||the operating system, the compiler, or the network. 
8||This book spans all of these aspects, with the unifying theme of a programmer's perspective.
9||If you study and learn the concepts in this book, you will be on your way to becoming the rare power programmer who knows how things work and how to fix them, why they break. 
10||You will be able to write programs that make better use of the capabilities provided by the operating system and systems software, that operate correctly across a wide range of operating conditions and runtime parameters, that run faster, and that avoid the flaws that make programs vulnerable to cyberattack. 
11||You will be prepared to delve deeper into advanced topics such as compilers, computer architecture, operating systems, embedded softwares, networking, and cybersecurity.
12||Learning how computer systems work from a programmer's perspective is great fun, mainly because you can do it actively. 
13||Whenever you learn something new, you can try it out right away and see the result firsthand. 
14||In fact, we believe that the only way to learn systems is to do systems, either working concrete problems or writing and running programs on real systems.
15||This theme pervades the entire book.
16||When a new concept is introduced, it is followed in the text by one or more practice problems that you should work immediately to test your understanding. 
17||Solutions to the practice problems are at the end of each chapter. 
18||As you read, try to solve each problem on your own and then check the solution to make sure you are on the right track. 
19||Each chapter is followed by a set of homework problems of varying difficulty. Your instructor has the solutions to the homework problems in an instructor's manual.
